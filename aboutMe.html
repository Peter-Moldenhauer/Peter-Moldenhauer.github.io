				Hello! My name is Peter Moldenhauer. As of March 2016 I decided to change career paths from the field of law enforcement/corrections into 
				the field of technology. The process of going back to school and diving into a new career field has been challenging yet rewarding. I could 
				not be happier with my decision to embark on this new journey and I am excited to see where this new path will take me. <br><br>
				
				In 2008 I received my first bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Upon graduating, I gained work 
				experience as a police reserve officer, paid-on-call firefighter, youth care worker and as a state correctional officer. <br><br>
				
				In late 2014 I made the decision to resign my employment as a state correctional officer sot aht my wife and I could travel the country and to 
				also give me the opportunity to seek out a new career path to take. Over the following two years, my wife and I moved from Wisconsin to North Carolina 
				to Texas to Arizona to Illinois and now back to Texas.<br><br>

				Throughout this journey I discovered how fascinating the field of technology is and in early 2016 I decided to make the jump to go back to school for 
				my second bachelor's degree - this time in computer science through Oregon State University.<br><br>
				
				When I am not working on schoolwork, I spend my free time exploring new programming languages and learning about many of the other areas that make 
				up the vast field of computer science. My motivation for building this website was that I wanted to look at two areas in particular - data structures and 
				algorithms, and get a deeper understanding of these crucial building blocks of computer science.<br><br>
				
				I hope to continually update this website with more data structures and algorithms as my knowlege in these topics grows...so check back in here at Structures, 
				Sorting and Such to stay refreshed in these core computer science concepts!<br><br>
