				<b>Data Structure vs. Abstract Data Type (ADT):</b><br>
				The study of data structures is concerned largely with the need to maintain collections of values. These are sometimes termed <i>containers</i>. 
				(Budd, Timothy. "An Active Learning approach to Data Structures using C") Over the years computer programmers have identified a few different ways 
				of organizing collections of data. These collections of data (i.e. "containers") are the core cocepts involved in the study of data structures. There 
				are numerous different types of these containers, each with their own different purposes and behaviors. These containers are commonly called "abstract 
				data types" (ADTs). In this website I will cover the implementation of the following abstract data types: 
				<ul>
					<li>Stack</li>
					<li>Bag</li>
					<li>Queue</li>
					<li>Deque</li>
					<li>Priority Queue</li>
					<li>Map</li>
				</ul>
				
				Although sometimes used interchangeably, the terms "abstract data types" and "data structures" refer to two different ideas. An abstract 
				data type is the general picture and description of the manner in which operations manipulate data. A data structure is the actual implementation and 
				algorithms that manipulates data in certain ways. In other words, an abstract data type is of the logical level and a data strucutre is of the 
				implementation level. For example, some of the common abstract data types are: stack, bag and queue. Some common data structures are dynamic arrays and 
				linked lists. A stack ADT can be implemented with a dynamic array or a linked list, similar to how a queue ADT can be implemented with a dynamic array or 
				a linked list as well. To put it more simply, an ADT can have many implementations using several different data structures. <br><br>
				
				<b>Three levels of Abstraction:</b><br>
				Wikipedia describes the term "abstraction" as "the process or result of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept to retain only 
				information which is relevant for a particular purpose." Relating this to data structures, there are three main levels of abstraction (abstract data types) in the study of data structures 
				that I should point out:
				<ul>
					<li>Interface: Describes the properties and behaviors of a collection of data - what does a specific abstract data type do?</li>
					<li>Application: How is a particular collection of data used - why is a specific abstract data type useful and what can you do with it?</li>
					<li>Implementation: Looks at specific implementations of certain abstract data types in a particular language - how to code a spcific abstract data type.</li>
				</ul>
				It should be noted that the first two levels of abstraction listed above are completely independent of any particular language. On this webpage (below) I will 
				describe these first two levels of abstraction for various abstract data types to give an idea of how and why they are used. Then, on each of the remaining links 
				in the dropdown menu I will describe how to code a given abstract data type using a spcific data structure and a specific language to code the data structure in. 
				I will primarilly use the C programming language to implement the abstract data types but I may also include code from some other languages periodically 
				to compare differences in the implementations.<br><br>
				
				<b>Stack ADT:</b><br>
				The Stack abstract data type is a <i>linear</i> collection. This means that the order that the elements are placed into is important. The specific order 
				property that a Stack has is a first-in, last-out (FILO) property (or also known as the other way around as having a last-in, first-out (LIFO) property). 
				This means that the first item added to the Stack is the last item removed, and the most recent item added to the stack is the first item removed. You can 
				visualize a Stack ADT as a stack of plates. You can only remove the top-most plate in the collection at a time. <br><br>
				The interface of a Stack typically has the three operations of push, top and pop. These are the three main things that a Stack can do. Push means to push something 
				on the top of the Stack. Top means to "look" at the value on top of the Stack. Pop means to take something off from the top of the Stack. These inteface functions 
				can be seen below as well as the two other functions to initialize a Stack and to determine if a stack is empty.
				<ul>
					<li>initStack();</li>
					<li>pushStack(val);</li>
					<li>vatType topStack();</li>
					<li>popStack();</li>
					<li>bool isEmptyStack();</li>
				</ul>
				There are many different uses and applications for a Stack ADT. A Stack is really good at "remembering" things, so one application for a stack would be to 
				check for balanced parenthesis. <br><br>
