				<b>Data Structure vs. Abstract Data Type (ADT):</b><br>
				"The study of data structures is concerned largely with the need to maintain collections of values. These are sometimes termed <i>containers</i>." 
				<a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2009/cs261/Textbook/Title.pdf">(source)</a> Over the years, computer programmers have identified a few different ways 
				of organizing collections of data. These collections of data are the core cocepts involved in the study of data structures. There 
				are numerous different types of these collections (or also called "containers"), each of which have their own different purposes and behaviors. These containers are commonly called "abstract 
				data types" (ADTs). In this website I will cover the implementation of the following abstract data types: 
				<ul>
					<li>Stack</li>
					<li>Bag</li>
					<li>Queue</li>
					<li>Deque</li>
					<li>Priority Queue</li>
					<li>Map</li>
				</ul>
				
				Although sometimes used interchangeably, the terms "abstract data types" and "data structures" refer to two different ideas. An abstract 
				data type is the general picture and description of the manner in which operations manipulate data. A data structure is the actual implementation and 
				algorithms that manipulates data in certain ways. In other words, an abstract data type is of the logical level and a data strucutre is of the 
				implementation level. For example, some of the common abstract data types are: stack, bag and queue. Some common data structures are dynamic arrays and 
				linked lists. A stack ADT can be implemented with a dynamic array or a linked list, similar to how a queue ADT can be implemented with a dynamic array or 
				a linked list as well. To put it more simply, an ADT can have many implementations using several different data structures. <br><br><br>
				
				<b>Three levels of Abstraction:</b><br>
				Wikipedia describes the term "abstraction" as "the process or result of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept to retain only 
				information which is relevant for a particular purpose."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)">(source)</a> 
				Relating this to data structures, there are three main levels of abstraction (abstract data types) in the study of data structures 
				that I should point out:
				<ul>
					<li>Interface: Describes the properties and behaviors of a collection of data - what does a specific abstract data type do?</li>
					<li>Application: How is a particular collection of data used - why is a specific abstract data type useful and what can you do with it?</li>
					<li>Implementation: Looks at specific implementations of certain abstract data types in a particular language - how to code a spcific abstract data type.</li>
				</ul>
				It should be noted that the first two levels of abstraction listed above are completely independent of any particular language. On this webpage (below) I will 
				describe these first two levels of abstraction for each of the abstract data types to give an idea of how and why they are used. Then, on each of the remaining links 
				in the dropdown menu I will describe how to code a given abstract data type using a spcific data structure and a specific language to code the data structure in. 
				I will primarilly use the C programming language to implement the abstract data types but I may also include code from some other languages periodically 
				to compare differences in the implementations.<br><br><br>
				
				<b>Stack ADT:</b><br>
				The Stack abstract data type is a <i>linear</i> collection. This means that the order that the elements are placed into is important. The specific order 
				property that a Stack has is a first-in, last-out (FILO) property (or also known as the other way around as having a last-in, first-out (LIFO) property). 
				This means that the first item added to the Stack is the last item removed, and the most recent item added to the stack is the first item removed. You can 
				visualize a Stack ADT as a stack of plates. You can only remove the top-most plate in the collection at a time. <br><br>
				The interface of a Stack typically has the three operations of push, top and pop. These are the three main things that a Stack can do. Push means to push something 
				on the top of the Stack. Top means to "look" at the value on top of the Stack. Pop means to take something off from the top of the Stack. These inteface functions 
				can be seen below as well as the two other functions to initialize a Stack and to determine if a stack is empty.
				<ul>
					<li>initStack();</li>
					<li>pushStack(val);</li>
					<li>vatType topStack();</li>
					<li>popStack();</li>
					<li>bool isEmptyStack();</li>
				</ul>
				There are many different uses and applications for a Stack ADT. A Stack is really good at "remembering" things, so one application for a stack would be to 
				process a mathmatical expression as a sring to check for balanced parenthesis. For example:
				<ul style="list-style:none;">
					<li>(2+3)) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// parens. are not balanced</li>
					<li>(2-3( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// parens. are not balanced</li>
					<li>((5+6*2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// parens. are balanced</li>
				</ul>
				A stack can solve this problem because it can go through the string one character at a time and each time an opening paren. is encountered, it is pushed 
				onto the Stack so that it is "remembered". Whenever operators or numbers are encountered then they are just ignored. Also, whenever you encounter a closing 
				paren. then the top of the Stack is popped off. If at the end of processing the string, there are still open parens. on the Stack then this means that the 
				expression did not have properly balanced parenthesis. Similarly, as the string is being processed, if the Stack should be popped (because a closeing paren. is 
				encountered) but the Stack is currently empty, then this also means that the expression is not properly balanced.<br><br>
				Some other appplications for a Stack may include: the back and forward buttons in a web browser, evaluating mathmatical postfix expressions, solving the "Towers 
				of Hanoi" problem, reversing the order of a word, the "undo" feature in text editors (they keep all text changes in a stack) and also buidling an activation 
				record when solving recursive functions.<br><br><br>
				
				<b>Bag ADT:</b><br>
				The Bag is the most basic of the abstract data types. The Bag is used in applications where you essentially need to maintain an unordered collection of elements. 
				So you don't care about the order of the elements when 
				they come in, you don't care about the order when they come out and you also don't care about the order that the elements are in when they are inside of the Bag. 
				There is no need to know how elements are organized inside of a Bag so therefore there are just three basic interface functions:
				<ul>
					<li>add(val);</li>
					<li>bool contains(val);</li>
					<li>remove(val);</li>
				</ul>
				With these three interface functions, you can add elements into the Bag, you can determine if there are elements are in the Bag already and you can remove elements from 
				the Bag.<br><br>
				The Bag ADT has many different uses and applications. One of which is a spell-checker. In this application, a Bag is used as a container to hold a dictionary of correctly 
				spelled words. Then, each word in a given file (or word document) is then tested against the words in the Bag. If a word in the file is not found inside of the Bag, then 
				it is flagged as a misspelled word. In short, any application that does not require "remembering" the order that elements are inserted into a container will most likely 
				use a variation of the Bag ADT.<br><br><br>
				
				<b>Queue ADT:</b><br>
				A Queue is an abstract data type that has the first-in, first-out (FIFO) property. Essentially a queue is like a line of people - people enter the line in the back and 
				they then exit the line in the front. Therefore, the first element added to a queue is the first element that is removed from that queue. The main interface operations 
				of a queue are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>int isEmpty();</li>
					<li>void addBack(TYPE val);</li>
					<li>TYPE front();</li>
					<li>void removeFront();</li>
				</ul>
				There are many applications for queues. Similar to the Stack ADT, a queue is also good at "remembering" - just in a different order. This is useful in searching graphs 
				such as the BFS algorithm. Queues also show up in operating systems a lot such as to store processes that are waiting to be run on the CPU. Also, queues work well in the 
				application of storing printing jobs that a printer may receive.<br><br><br>
				
				<b>Deque ADT:</b><br>
				The deque is very similar to a queue except that with a deque, elements can be added or removed from either side. The word "deque" basically means "double ended queue". 
				This is almost like putting the stack operations and the queue operations and then putting them together. Overall, the deque ADT is more flexible than simply the stack 
				or queue because it allows for additions and removals from both sides.<br><br>

				The deque has numerous applications that a stack or queue would not be able to pull off. One of these is a finite length undo feature in a word processing software. 
				For example if a developer wanted to only allow for a maximum of 20 operations to be added into the "undo container" at a time, a deque would make for the best ADT 
				to pull this off.
