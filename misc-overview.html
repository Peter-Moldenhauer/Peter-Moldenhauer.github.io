				<b>What is an algorithm?</b><br>
				As we look deeper into the different kinds and complexities of algorithms, it is important to first get a solid understanding of what exactly an algorithm is. 
				"Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, 
				or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output." 
				<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033844">(source)</a> In simple terms, an algorithm is commonly known as a sequence of steps which solve a problem 
				or task. However, there are three important characteristics that are lesser known that all algorithms must have to be considered valid:
				<ol>
					<li>It should be finite: If an algorithm does not terminate and never ends trying to solve the problem that it was designed to solve, then it is not an algorithm.</li>
					<li>It should have well defined instructions: Each step of the algorithm has to be precisely defined. The instructions should be unambiguously specified for each case.</li>
					<li>It should be effective: An algorithm should solve the problem it was designed to solve and it is possible to prove that the algorithm does indeed solve the problem. </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				
				<b>The different types of algorithms:</b><br>
				The world of algorithms goes much deeper than the data structures and sorting algorithms that I described on the other pages of this website. Algorithms are 
				everywhere and you most likely use algorithms when you don't even realize it. The remaining webpages in this section will look at a variety of  
				algorithms that are commonly used and each serve a unique purpose. In these webpages I will focus on describing the overall concept of each algorithm instead of actually 
				implementing the algorithms in code. Some of the algorithms I will cover in this section would be extremely challenging 
				to put into a short section of code, such as Google's PageRank algorithm.
